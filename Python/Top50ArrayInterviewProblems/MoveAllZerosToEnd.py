[Naive Approach] Using Temporary Array â€“ O(n) Time and O(n) Space

The idea is to create a temporary array of same size as the input array arr[]. 


First, copy all non-zero elements from arr[] to the temporary array. 
Then, fill all the remaining positions in temporary array with 0.
Finally, copy all the elements from temporary array to arr[].
